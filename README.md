### Note to the company:
Thank you for allowing me this assignment. I haven't been this challenged learning a new technology in a while. It was extra challenging seeing web3-react doesn't have great documentation yet. I hope this assignment is up to your expectations. Regardless, this was a fun assignment.

Stay safe!
